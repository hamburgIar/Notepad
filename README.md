There are a lot of flaws in my notepad, such as poor optimization for a large number of lines, and line wrapping does not work as it should. But I'll fix it somehow) Code highlighting has been added, supports more than 10 languages and all their extensions. The interface has been updated, now the control is completely from the keyboard. 

Keyboard shortcuts:\
ctrl + shift + Q: Open file (Dialog box)\
ctrl + shift + X: Close the file\
ctrl + S: Save file\
ctrl + shift + B: Delete the file (There will be a dialog box, so you won't be able to delete it by chance)\
ctrl + shift + N: Create a new file (Dialog box)

It turned out well, I'll fix the bugs later)
